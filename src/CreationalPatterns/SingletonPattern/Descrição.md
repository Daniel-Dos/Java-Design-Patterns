# Singleton Patterns

GoF Definition: Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.

# Concept
A particular class should have only one instance. We will use only that instance whenever we are in need.

#Real-Life Exemple

Suppose you are a member of a cricket team. And in a tournament your team is going to play against another team.
As per the rules of the game, the captain of each side must go for a toss to decide which side will bat (or bowl) first.
So, if your team does not have a captain, you need to elect someone as a captain first. And at the same time, your team cannot
have more than one captain.

#Computer World Exemple

In a software system sometimes we may decide to use only one file system. Usually we may use it for the centralized management of resources.
